      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <p>There is this game that I simply adore called <span class="italics">Mobile Legends: Bang Bang.</span> It is what is classified as a MOBA game, or a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. These are games that usually consists of 5v5s, popular titles including League of Legends or DOTA 2. Like games of these titles, MLBB consists of 5 roles for the five players, The Jungler, The Roamer, The Mid-Laner, The Gold-Laner, and The EXP-Laner. These 5 roles try to coordinate and destroy the opponent's Nexus on the other side of the map. This page will go in-depth on the details of 3 heroes that I commonly use in the game.</p>

        <p class="iblock txt-size"><span class="italics">Mobile Legend: Bang Bang</span> is a game developed by a Chinese company called <span class="italics">Moonton</span> in 2016. Initially shot down multiple times due to copyright concerns from <span class="italics">Riot</span>, it finally deleted most of its plagiarized content and became a mainstream mobile game all over the world.</p>
