      <center><h2>Summary</h2></center>
      <p>Zilong is one of the first heroes in MLBB. He is a Fighter/Assassin, and could easily chase down enemies and delete them. He is rather infamous as an extremely easy to play hero and also being extremely weak in higher ranks.</p>

      <center><h2>Playstyle</h2></center>
      <p>Zilong is extremely weak early-game, as he needs items in order to do any damage. Therefore, try to farm as much gold as possible, and in late-game, you could easily shred through groups of enemies.</p>
